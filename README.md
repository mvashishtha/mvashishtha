I'm Mahesh Vashishtha, a software engineer working at [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/) on Snowpark Python. Previously, I worked at [Ponder Data](https://www.ponder.io). There I contributed to [Modin](https://github.com/modin-project/modin), a drop-in replacement for pandas that scales automatically using a backend of your choice, and to the ponder library.
