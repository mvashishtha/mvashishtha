### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mahesh Vashishtha, a software engineer at [Ponder](https://www.ponder.io) working on the future of scalable data science! Specifically, I've been working on [Modin](https://github.com/modin-project/modin), a drop-in replacement for pandas that scales automatically using a backend of your choice.
